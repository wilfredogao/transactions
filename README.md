## Writeup
-------

Overall this assignment was good practice for implementing a basic transactions database. I think all the assignments in the current course structure are useful and help to reinforce the ideas learned in lecture; therefore, I'm not sure if this new assignment would replace a previous one. 
In terms of modifictaions, I would change assignment details to mention:
* Fig 1: shows the header file for the InMemoryDB class
* Fig 2: shows what will be executed in main

Likewise, to detail what should happen in case of an error occurring. This perhaps can be implemented by mentioning it in Fig 2 or showing an example output display for reference in the assignment details. 
In terms of grading, I would change the 4 points for working code to be more detailed. This could be implemented by detailing similar to below:
4 points for working code:
* 1 point for get and put functionality
* 1 point for begin transactions functionality
* 1 point for commit functionality
* 1 point for rollback functionality
