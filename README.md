## Writeup
-------

Overall this assignment was good practice for implementing a basic transactions database. 

In terms of modifictaions, I would change assignment details to mention:
* Fig 1: shows the header file for the InMemoryDB class
* Fig 2: shows what will be executed in main

Likewise, to detail what should happen in case of an error occurring either in Fig. 2 or showing an example output display for reference in the assignment details.

In terms of grading, I would change the 4 points for working code to be more detailed, similar to below:

4 points for working code:
* 1 point for get and put functionality
* 1 point for begin transactions functionality
* 1 point for commit functionality
* 1 point for rollback functionality
